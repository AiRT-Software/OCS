MessageCodes.cs was replicated in two folders, one for Unity and one for C++.

Now there is just one copy of that file, in:

trunk/jiminy/airt_unity/Assets/Connection/Scripts/MessageCodes.cs

If you want to add new codes, add them to that file.

The current C++ project expects a MessageCodes.h file that is generated automatically by 
cmake from the .cs file. Just build the project and it will appear. Take into account:

-do not modify the new MessageCodes.h (modify the MessageCodes.cs in airt_unity instead and ask cmake to rebuild the project)
-do not add MessageCodes.h into subversion
