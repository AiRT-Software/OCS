# example cmdline

This example shows how to compile a program using restc-cpp from the command-line.

We assume that the library has been built and installed.

Currently this example is only tested under Linux.

```sh
~/src/restc-cpp/examples/cmdline$ ./build.sh
~/src/restc-cpp/examples/cmdline$ ./a.out
